## Building Canis
Canis requires at least Go 1.14 to compile and docker >= 19.0 to create the containers required to launch Canis using either the
docker or kubernetes environment.  

It is theoretically possible to run the components of Canis (apiserver, didcomm-doorman, didcomm-issuer, didcomm-verifier, didcomm-lb) 
locally by hand but that is not a recommended approach and bypasses the power of the Canis integrated architecture.

Compiling the binaries is as simple as:

```
% make
```

After building Canis it is a good idea to run the tests:

```
% make test
```

The [Getting Started Guide](/docs/GettingStarted.md) assumes the docker execution environment.  To build
the canis docker container required for the docker execution environment, ensure docker is installed and run the following:

```
% make canis-docker
```
